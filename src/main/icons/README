As of Jan 2017:
 * Windows uses Icon.ico
 * Mac uses icons/base + icons/mac
 * Linux (Ubuntu) uses icons/base + icons/linux.

The difference between the icons on Mac and the other platforms is that on Mac,
they contain a ~10% transparent margin. This is because otherwise they look too
big (eg. in the Dock or in the app switcher).

The icons on Mac were created from the .ai files submitted by the designer, via
"Slices" in Sketch.

Icon.ico was created from the .png files submitted by the designer with [1].
