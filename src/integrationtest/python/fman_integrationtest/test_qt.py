"""
This module contains all tests that require a QApplication to run.

In an ideal world, tests that require a QApplication would start it in setUp(),
and stop it in tearDown(). Unfortunately, this does not work: A process can
only start one QApplication. Further attempts segfault.

The purpose of this module is to work around the above limitation. It manages
the QApplication lifecycle for tests that require it. To achieve this,
setUpModule() and tearDownModule() are used to start / stop the app exactly once
for the entire process. Unfortunately, this requires us to define all affected
tests here, in this module.

A subtle but important point is that the QApp managed by this module runs in
a separate thread, which is not the main thread of the process. This normally
makes Qt print a warning. We suppress it with a custom QtMessageHandler.
